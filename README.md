# DraftDiff

You know DraftKings? Its like that but for my friends league of legends games.

List of things I still need to implement / maybe will implement:

- Fix major bugs and complete a final walkthrough
- Command that showcases all active games.
- Find a way to host this all not on my laptop.

# Current Bugs
- Race condition when multiple people start a game at the same time
- Prediction Validation Bug
