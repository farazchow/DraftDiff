# DraftDiff

You know DraftKings? Its like that but for my friends league of legends games.

List of things I still need to implement / maybe will implement:

- Fix major bugs and complete a final walkthrough
- Fix bet message to properly show who is playing in the game.
- Have the bot send a message when a game is over and saying who won and how many points were lost/gained.
- If a player wins the game they were playing, they should gain at least double the amount of points they wagered.
- A "mailbox" system so users can see their transactions and active bets.
- A command that sends money from one user to another
- Virtual slot machine that a user can punt points on
- Virtual reward shop for redeeming points.
- Command that links to this repo. _Hello!_
- Command that showcases all active games.
- Find a way to host this all not on my laptop.
