# DraftDiff

You know DraftKings? Its like that but for my friends league of legends games.

List of things I still need to implement / maybe will implement:

- Fix major bugs and complete a final walkthrough
- A "mailbox" system so users can see their transactions and active bets.
- A command that sends money from one user to another
- Command that showcases all active games.
- Find a way to host this all not on my laptop.
- A leaderboard command
- Change bet system to not take other's points

# Current Bugs
- Race condition when multiple people start a game at the same time
- Prediction Validation Bug
